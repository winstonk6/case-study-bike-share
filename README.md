# Case Study: How does a bike-share navigate speedy success?

This repository contains the results of my [Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-data-analytics) capstone project, where I analyze data from [Divvy](https://divvybikes.com/about), a bike-share program in Chicago.

- The data used for this project is not included in this repository, but can be downloaded from [Divvy](https://divvybikes.com/system-data).
- Data cleaning, analysis, and visualization steps were done in the [Analysis.qmd](https://github.com/winstonk6/case-study-bike-share/blob/6c8b67b531cf2ff52d7f7f3270b48e61ec7a02fb/Analysis.qmd) file using R. The results can be seen by downloading and opening the [Analysis.html](https://github.com/winstonk6/case-study-bike-share/blob/6c8b67b531cf2ff52d7f7f3270b48e61ec7a02fb/Analysis.html) file.
- An interactive presentation of the results can be viewed by downloading and opening the [Presentation.html](https://github.com/winstonk6/case-study-bike-share/blob/6c8b67b531cf2ff52d7f7f3270b48e61ec7a02fb/Presentation.html) file. A PDF version of the presentation can be found in the [Presentation_pdf.pdf](https://github.com/winstonk6/case-study-bike-share/blob/6c8b67b531cf2ff52d7f7f3270b48e61ec7a02fb/Presentation_pdf.pdf) file.
